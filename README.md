# dynamical_systems
Dynamical systems are foundational in modeling our universe. This project attempts to showcase the beauty that these systems can create. From abelian sandpiles, to strange attractors, to Turing patterns, and beyond, there is no shortage of dynamical systems that create interesting behaviour.

Each folder represents a different dynamical system. It holds a description of the system, code for a picture/animation, sample output, and instructions for using the file.

I hope this inspires other people to do their own projects.
