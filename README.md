# dynamical_systems
Dynamical systems are foundational in modeling our universe. This project attempts to showcase the beauty that these systems can create. From abelian sandpiles, to strange attractors, to Turing patterns, and beyond, there is no shortage of dynamical systems that create interesting behaviour.

Each dynamical system has a folder. In this folder is a description of the system, code for a picture/animation, sample output, and instructions on how to use the file.

Many times a project will take many attempts to get just right. These attempts will be put in a "old" subfolder. The code generally works, but will be slower or produce a different output.

The content found in the media folders is often edited to present better on Twitter or other online platforms, so the output from the program may not be 100% what is found in the media folders.
